            I’m a people person. I’m the kid who got you kicked out of class for
            goofing off with me. I’m still that kid. My greatest achievement is
            my daughter, Zoe. I love to explore new music. I’m also a leader
            with the ManKind Project, a non-profit personal development
            organization for men. I have a bachelor’s degree in theatre and
            English from Truman State and a master’s degree in English from the
            University of Illinois-Chicago.

            After I got my Master’s in English, I was doing improv at a theatre
            in Chicago. Hanging out after shows, I’d hear actors complain about
            the personalities of their photographers. They described them as
            rude and egotistical. I always loved photography and did it nonstop
            from my first year of high school through graduate school. Why don’t
            I open a studio, I thought? At least I won’t be an a*%hole! Aaron
            Gang Photography was born on that simple premise in 1998.

            I started with actors, which led to models, professionals, and
            corporations. In 2016, I expanded to serve families and pets. I
            wanted to make art for the wall to help families and pet parents
            celebrate their gifts.

            I love stand-up paddle boarding and learned to snowboard at age 50.
            I also love all lawn games, especially frisbee and bocce ball. I’m
            an unabashed TV watcher and a sci-fi novel geek.

            I love to get to know people and have fun with them. That always
            leads to great photography
