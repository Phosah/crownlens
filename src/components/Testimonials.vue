        I’m a people person. I’m the kid who got you kicked out of class for
        goofing off with me. I’m still that kid. My greatest achievement is my
        daughter, Zoe. I love to explore new music. I’m also a leader with the
        ManKind Project, a non-profit personal development organization for men.
        I have a bachelor’s degree in theatre and English from Truman State and
        a master’s degree in English from the University of Illinois-Chicago
